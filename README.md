## Nilva React Code Challange

you can find demo here: [Country Match](https://country-match.netlify.app/)

## Details

- I build it with CRA, style it with SASS and make it responsive .

- some issue about API:

1- this api in neighbor field have some problem and it is not correct, for example: iran have afghanistan as neighbor but in afghanistan neighbor's field we can't find iran!

2- how all countries neighbor's has fixed array with length of 5!

- btw i have good time to make this app.ðŸ˜Ž

## Tasks

- fetch a list of `10 random, unique` countries from the list of countries in the endpoint below. e.g. Canada, USA, Japan, etc.
  [travelbriefing.org](https://travelbriefing.org/api)

- check the 10 countries to see which countries are `mutual neighbors`. this means these countries have each other in their `neighbors` field. are mutual neighbors.

- feel free to display the mutual neighbors in any way that makes sense to you. Note: if you find that `Canada` and `USA` are mutual neighbors, you should only display the pair once.

## Teches

- main framework: [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
- style framework: [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- data fetching: [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
